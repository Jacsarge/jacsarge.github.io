## My Work

### The Blablablab REU

This Summer, I'm working with Dr. Jurgens in the Blablablab at the University of Michigan School of Information on two projects. The first is working to computationally identify context appropriate language, and the second is developing an annotation tool for use in building datasets.

### Claudius Legal Intelligence

Claudius Legal Intelligence is a legal AI startup formed by researchers at Princeton. I've joined the company's research division, focusing on research into Algorithmic Fairness and Bias. With them I've used and imnplemented different fairness measuring systems for classification problems and am working to develop new fairness measures for new domains and contexts.

### MinDS @ Mines

As a part of the Google funded CS@Mines Developing Hidden Talents program, I'm working with Lodewijk Brand on a project developing Multi-Instance Learning technology. Through this project I've worked with Neural Networks in both Python and Julia, developing models to compare technologies, and demonstrating novel features and improvements in our work.

### comp.social

From the Fall of 2018 to March of 2020 I worked with Dr. Gilbert in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I've done data analysis to guide the development of a classifier which identifies Russian trolls on Twitter, and helped author the paper [Still out there: Modeling and Identifying Russian Troll Accounts on Twitter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11162), which was awarded Best Paper Runner Up at WebSci '20. I also have developed a prototype app which uses location data and Facebook connection to incentivize purchasing carbon offsets after flights. My work in this lab has taught me many technical skills in software development and data analysis, as well as bolstered my abilities to ask questions and think creatively.

### Michigan Data Science Team

Since the winter of 2019 I've worked along side both undergraduate and graduate level students as a member of the Michigan Data Science Team. Through this club I've been able to work in and lead projects in natural language processing, time-series analysis, and machine learning. Over the Winter of 2021 I lead the MDChessT project, which involved building two types of chess engines. Along with my work in projects, I've worked as the VP of Finance over the 2019-2020 school year and President over the 2020-2021 school year. My work with MDST has developed not only my technical skills, but my ability to work as part of a team and manage a large group of people. 

### Michigan Research and Discovery Scholares

In the Winter of 2019 I've worked along side both undergraduate and graduate level students as a member of the Michigan Data Science Team. Through this club I've been able to work in and lead projects in natural language processing, time-series analysis, and machine learning. These include the project I lead Winter of 2020, Debate Bingo. In this project we analyzed the Democratic Primary Debate transcripts to pull out insights about the various candidates and create bingo cards based on their language and behavior on the debate stage. Along with my work in projects, I've worked as the VP of Finance over the 2019-2020 school year and will continue to lead the club going forward. My work as VP of Finance and as a project leader have developed not only my technical skills, but my ability to work as part of a team and manage a large group of people.
